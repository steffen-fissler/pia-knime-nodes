PIA nodes for KNIME
===================

This project contains the source for PIA nodes for KNIME.

PIA is a toolbox for MS based protein inference and identification analysis.

PIA allows you to inspect the results of common proteomics spectrum identification search engines, combine them semlessly and conduct statistical analyses. The main focus of PIA lays on the integrated inference algorithms, i.e. concluding the proteins from a set of identified spectra. But it also allows you to inspect your peptide spectrum matches, calculate FDR values across different search engine results and visualize the correspondence between PSMs, peptides and proteins.

For more information, please refer to the [main PIA project](https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/pia) and the [PIA WiKi]( https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/pia/wiki).

This branch is for the nodes used in **KNIME 3.1**.
